## Target User

**Primary Persona:** Novice home gardeners with limited space

**Who they are:**
- Home gardeners growing vegetables and herbs for personal use
- Urban gardeners with limited space (balconies, small yards, raised beds)
- Beginners who are new to gardening and need guidance

**Skill Level:** Novice - Have tried gardening but struggle with timing and planning

**Key Frustrations:**
- Don't know when to plant different crops for their location
- Poor planning leads to inefficient use of space and unbalanced harvests

**Current Solutions:** Spreadsheets, gardening books, generic apps, guesswork

---

## Core Problem

**Problem Statement:** Novice gardeners struggle with knowing when to plant and how to plan their garden effectively, leading to poor harvests, wasted effort, and eventual abandonment of gardening.

**Problem Characteristics:**

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Frequency | Weekly - ongoing decisions throughout the season |
| Severity | High - causes poor yields, constant stress, giving up |
| Problem Score | **High Priority** |

**Consequences if unsolved:**
- Constant stress and anxiety about whether they're doing it right
- Poor harvests from missed planting windows
- Many give up on gardening entirely

## Value Proposition

**Why Square Gardener?**

| Differentiator | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Visual grid planning | See your garden laid out in squares, not just a list |
| Automatic scheduling | Know when to plant based on your frost dates |
| Companion planting | Place plants that grow well together |

**Core Strength:** Square foot garden visualization

The visual grid approach to garden planning is the killer feature. Users can see their garden spatially, understand how plants fit together, and plan more effectively than with lists or spreadsheets.

**Switching triggers:**
- *To Square Gardener:* Visual approach makes planning tangible and less overwhelming
- *Away from Square Gardener:* If the app becomes complex or loses its simplicity

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Type | Why It Matters |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Weekly Active Users** | Primary KPI | Users returning each week during growing season |
| Gardens Created | Engagement | Users setting up beds and adding plants |
| Return Visits | Retention | Users coming back week after week |
| Feature Adoption | Engagement | Usage across planning and calendar features |

**Success looks like:** Users who create a garden plan, return weekly to check their planting calendar, and come back next season.

## Anti-Goals

> **These are things we will NOT build.** If a feature request falls into these categories, the answer is no.

### Explicit Non-Goals

| Anti-Goal | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Social/community features | No sharing, forums, or social feeds - focus on individual planning |
| Professional/farm scale | Not for commercial growers or large operations |
| IoT/smart garden integration | No sensors, automated systems, or device connections |

### Out of Scope Problems

| Problem | Why Out of Scope |
|---------|------------------|
| Pest/disease diagnosis | Not a plant doctor - different product entirely |
| Soil testing/analysis | Requires different expertise and possibly hardware |
| Weather forecasting | We use frost dates, not real-time weather |

---

## Key Constraints

| Constraint | Impact on Decisions |
|------------|---------------------|
| Solo/small team | Must keep scope focused, avoid feature bloat |
| Web-only deployment | GitHub Pages hosting, no backend services |

## Feature Evaluation Checklist

When evaluating a new feature idea, ask:

1. **Target User:** Does this serve novice home/urban gardeners?
2. **Core Problem:** Does this help with timing or planning?
3. **Differentiator:** Does this enhance visual grid planning?
4. **Anti-Goal Check:** Is this explicitly something we said NO to?
5. **Constraint Check:** Can we build this with our current constraints?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ Yes to 1-3, No to 4, Yes to 5 → **Build it**
- ❌ Fails any check → **Don't build it** (or revisit the canvas)
